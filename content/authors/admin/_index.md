Aviral Agarwal is an graduate student at Stanford Environmental Engineering. He has completed his Bachelor of Technology from Delhi Technology with departmental rank 1. Aviral has also worked on ArcGIS and data visualization through Python through a research project associated with the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, to conduct a multi-city air pollution exposure study. He analyzed predictor variables like spatial traffic proxies for subject locations, which lead to developing a multivariate regression model. Additionally, he interned at a policy research think-tank in Delhi, where he conducted secondary research on numerous environmental, social, and health concerns, financing, policies regarding mine closure.

His undergraduate research pursuits in spatial data science, renewables, and air pollution assessment have culminated in research publications in international peer-reviewed journals that sharpened his technical writing skills. While pursuing his undergrad projects and internships, he has developed a fascination with data science, modeling, and its applications in environmental sustainability. Currently, Aviral is expanding his horizons towards data analytics and machine learning through hands-on projects. In addition, he is interested in working on interdisciplinary projects to widen his skill set in developing predictive models.
